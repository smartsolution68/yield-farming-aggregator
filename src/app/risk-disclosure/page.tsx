                You could lose everything. Smart contracts have bugs. Protocols get hacked. Markets crash. We farm on other people&lsquo;s protocols - if they fail, you lose.
                This is degen territory, not a savings account. Only deposit what you can afford to lose completely. We&lsquo;re yield hunters, not your financial advisor. DYOR.
